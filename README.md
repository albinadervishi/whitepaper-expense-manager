## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone 
cd team-expense-manager
```

### 2. Install dependencies

**Server:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

**Client:**
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory based on `.env.example`:

```bash
# Database Configuration MongoDb Atlas
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/team-expense-manager

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000

# OpenAI API Configuration
# https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_api_key

# Brevo Email Service Configuration
# https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api
BREVO_API_KEY=brevo_api_key
# Your verified sender email in Brevo
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@team_expense_manager.com
```

### 5. Seed the database (optional)

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

This will create sample teams and expenses for testing.

### 6. Run the application

**Terminal 1 - Start the backend server:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

**Terminal 2 - Start the frontend client:**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The client will run on `http://localhost:5173`

## AI Feature: Smart Category Suggestion

### Choice: Smart Categorization

I implemented **AI-powered expense category suggestion** using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

### How It Works

1. **Quick Keyword Match**: First checks for common keywords (e.g., "flight", "restaurant", "laptop")
2. **AI Analysis**: If no match, uses OpenAI to analyze the description context
3. **Confidence Score**: Returns category with confidence level (0-100)
4. **Auto-fill**: Frontend auto-fills category if confidence â‰¥ 85%

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Service Layer Pattern

Separated business logic from routes into service layers:
- `teamService.ts`: Team CRUD and budget calculations
- `expenseService.ts`: Expense CRUD, budget alerts, and email triggers
- `aiService.ts`: AI categorization logic
- `emailService.ts`: Email sending abstraction

### 2. Normalized Data Model

- Teams and Expenses are separate collections with `ObjectId` references
- `totalSpent` is calculated and stored on Team (for performance)
- Indexes on `teamId` and `date` for efficient queries

### 3. Budget Alert System

- Tracks `alertSent80` and `alertSent100` flags to prevent duplicate emails
- Alerts trigger when expenses are created/updated
- Flags reset when spending drops

### 4. Validation Strategy

- **Frontend**: Zod schemas for immediate user feedback
- **Backend**: Mongoose schema validation for data integrity

### 5. Error Handling

- Consistent error response format: `{ success: boolean, error?: string, data?: any }`
- External service failures (email, AI) don't crash the app
